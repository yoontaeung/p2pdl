## Overview

P2PDL is a peer-to-peer decentralized learning protocol that hosts end users to contribute to the training process. Our protocol aims to tolerate faults from malicious users through an incentive mechanism and trust-less learning progress.Â 

### TODO

- **Incentive mechanism**: Incentive mechanism enables users to get incentives based on their training result. 
- **Storing local updates to blockchain**: The local model updates from each node will be stored in blockchain. 
- **Advanced model & datasets**
- **Byzantine fault**
- **CLI**
- ~~**Client selection**~~
